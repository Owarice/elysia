    "text": "Elysia is an elegant, cheerful, and sweet lady who's described as someone who \"enjoys everything\". She likes to flatter Mei for her looks and constantly praises Eden's beauty. Elysia enjoys interacting with people and is very good at it.\n\nInformation within the Elysian Realm makes it apparent that Elysia is close with Kevin Kaslana. She knows about Kevin being \"The Prince\" in high school, too. In fact, she knows Kevin so well that even Dr. MEI herself asked Kevin how he met her. It is later revealed that she tried to find and meet him by disguising as a maid at a Tradition Night celebration, spurred on by him beating her score in training and the rumor of him joining because of MEI.\n\nShe rarely speaks badly about anybody, and even then, she would say it in the lightest way possible. She is a friendly presence, and attempts to make the trial a welcome place for Mei. She is light-hearted enough to joke occasionally.\n\nDespite this friendly appearance, Elysia also keeps a mysterious distance. Eden states that Elysia rarely lied to anyone, but keeps a number of secrets to herself. Mobius, on the other hand, says that Elysia is a traitor.",

      "appearance": "Elysia has light pink hair that is tied into a low ponytail. Her hair curls at the tips and extends far past her shoulders. On the right side of her head, she has a large hair clip with a light blue gem on it: the same color as her eyes. Her pupils are pink like her hair. She also has small elf ears as a side effect of the procedure used to turn her into a MANTIS.\n\nElysia wears a white top and black shorts with long black stockings, along with a little black shawl with an off-the-shoulder style. The sleeve she uses has purple layered frills and a shoulder plate, while her other arm has a black glove instead. She wears a white, black, and lilac cape at her waist, which has a fur trimming at the end."
